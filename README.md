## Introduction
This paper investigates whether large language models can reliably/consistently express their confidence using epistemic markers instead of numerical values. Our findings indicate that while LLMs' in-distribution marker confidence is relatively stable, its consistency declines in out-of-distribution scenarios in different perspectives, raising concerns about the reliability of such markers for confidence estimation.
